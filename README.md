Green
=====
I'm one of the many gamers who happens to have a green drive. Green drives are notorious for head parking or spinning down a drive after a few seconds of inactivity regardless of any setting you set on your computer.

This can be quite annoying when you're playing a game, and the program decides it needs to load a texture or a animation and guess what, the drive is spun down. So then the computer freezes momentarily (3-5 seconds) before it can actually load the data off the hdd. This is can be quite disorientating as it happens quite frequently and abruptly .

I have suffered quite a lot of character death because of it. So I decided to write a program that reads a file from your hdd every 3-4 seconds to keep the hdd spinning. It's written in python 3.x and licensed under the gpl v2.

Running
=======

To run the program, simply download the entire source folder and run spin.py. Python 3.x is required.
